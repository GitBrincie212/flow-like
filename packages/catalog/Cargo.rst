```

**Important Notes:**

*   **Workspace Dependencies:**  The `workspace = true` entries mean that the crate being referenced is expected to be in the root of your project.  This is a common pattern for internal dependencies.
*   **Test Expansion:** These test cases are very basic.  For a real project, you'd want to add more robust tests that actually *use* the dependencies and verify their behavior.  This would include integration tests, unit tests, and potentially property-based tests.
*   **Version Constraints:**  The version constraints are crucial. Make sure that the versions specified in `Cargo.toml` are appropriate for your project and dependencies.  Consider using semantic versioning (semver) and appropriate ranges.
*   **Features:**  The `features = [...]` sections enable or disable specific functionality within a crate. Test that the required features are enabled.
*   **Error Handling:**  Consider adding tests to check for expected errors and exceptions that might be raised by the dependencies.
*   **Documentation:**  As you add more tests, document the purpose and expected behavior of each test.
