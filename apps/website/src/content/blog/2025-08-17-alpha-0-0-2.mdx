Three months after our very first public alpha ‚Äî and just one week after shipping **Alpha v0.0.1** ‚Äî we‚Äôre back with **Alpha v0.0.2** (published Aug 17, 2025).
This tag is all about **faster prototyping, stronger security, and smoother execution**. ([GitHub][1])

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Alpha quality: still not production ‚Äî please test, break, and report. ([GitHub][1])

## What‚Äôs new

### Rapid Prototyping Mode (Layered Nodes)

The biggest addition in this release is **Rapid Prototyping mode**. You can now drop in **placeholder nodes** to sketch workflows before wiring them to real technical implementations.

Instead of switching between ‚Äúbusiness idea‚Äù and ‚Äútechnical solution,‚Äù you can now **combine both in one flow**. Early brainstorming is smoother, and sharing concepts with teammates is easier.

Here‚Äôs a short demo:

This lays the foundation for fast idea-to-execution pipelines: start with abstract nodes, then refine them into fully operational ones as the project matures.

### New Models: Qwen 3 & Qwen 2.5 VL

We‚Äôve added support for two major new models:

- **Qwen 3** ‚Üí a strong reasoning-first language model, tuned for **logic, analysis, and code-heavy workflows**.
- **Qwen 2.5 VL** ‚Üí a multimodal vision-language model that handles **images + text** together, making it perfect for visual automation, annotation, and AI agents that need to ‚Äúsee‚Äù and ‚Äúread.‚Äù

These models join our growing library, giving you broader options for experimentation and production-like testing.

---

### Lockable Layers

A small but highly requested feature: you can now **lock layers**.
No more accidental nudges when presenting or collaborating ‚Äî lock them in place once your structure is set, and focus on the logic.

---

### New E-Mail Nodes (SMTP + IMAP)

We‚Äôre bringing automation straight to your inbox.
With the new **generic SMTP and IMAP nodes**, you can now:

- **Read your mails** directly in a flow
- **Organize mails into folders** automatically
- **Manage your folder structure**
- **Create drafts** for review or scheduled sending
- **Send messages directly** from Flow-Like
- ‚Ä¶and much more!

Everything is ready for **mailbox automation** ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre building personal workflows or enterprise-scale mail processing pipelines.

---

### Secure Offline Sharing (xChaCha20 + BLAKE3-HMAC)

For teams that need to share flows **offline** or in **air-gapped environments**, we‚Äôve built a secure sharing mechanism powered by modern cryptography:

- **xChaCha20** ‚Üí a stream cipher designed for performance and safety, with a 192-bit nonce that eliminates the risks of nonce reuse.
- **BLAKE3 (HMAC)** ‚Üí a fast, parallelizable hashing algorithm used here for authentication and integrity checks.

The combination means you get **enterprise-grade encryption** without sacrificing speed, ensuring your flows remain private and tamper-proof.

---

### Execution Fixes: Nested + Parallel

We‚Äôve smoothed out execution logic across the board:

- **Nested Parallel Execution** now behaves as expected.
- **Parallel Model Execution** allows for parallel model and embedding model invocation.

Complex orchestration is now much more reliable.

## Thank you, community & contributors

This release was heavily shaped by your feedback from v0.0.1.
Every report, idea, and suggestion helps make Flow-Like stronger. Please keep them coming. üíô ([GitHub][1])

---

## Get it & try it

Grab installers and artifacts from the **Alpha v0.0.2 release page** ‚Äî then open an issue with repro steps if something breaks. We‚Äôre still reading everything. ([GitHub][1])

---

## What‚Äôs next

- Richer typing across nodes and data edges
- Built-in evaluation tools for flows
- Governance & observability for enterprise workflows

If you‚Äôre experimenting with us this early, you‚Äôre helping shape the foundation of Flow-Like.
Thanks for being here!
