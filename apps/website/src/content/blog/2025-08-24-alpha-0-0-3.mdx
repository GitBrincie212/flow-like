------------

One week after **Alpha v0.0.2** (Aug 17, 2025), we’re shipping **Alpha v0.0.3** with a focus on **data visibility, theming, agentic workflows, and quality-of-life editing**. Thank you for the fast feedback loop — it’s pushing the platform forward at high speed. 💙

> ⚠️ **Alpha quality**: still not production. Please test aggressively and file issues with repro steps. We read everything.

## Highlights

### Fast **Table Preview** (Data at a glance) — [#161](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/issues/161)

Quickly inspect tabular results right inside Flow-Like. The new preview is built for iteration:

* Smooth scrolling on large tables
* Column autosizing & resizing
* Sticky header and row index for orientation
* Type badges on columns to spot schema issues early
* Copy single cell / row actions for rapid debugging

Perfect for validating intermediate steps, CSVs, query results, and model outputs — without leaving your flow.

---

### **Create Your Own Theme** — [#219](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/issues/219)

Make Flow-Like feel like *your* workspace. You can now design themes end-to-end:

* Define brand colors, radii, and surface styles
* Preview changes live across nodes, pins, and panels
* Save and switch between multiple themes per workspace

Great for white-label deployments and teams that care about consistent visual language.

**How-To**:
1. Open `Edit profile`.
2. Select `Custom Theme`.
3. Visit <a href="https://tweakcn.com?ref=flow-like">tweakcn</a>.
4. Create your theme.
5. Export code for Tailwind v4 + OKLCH.
6. Paste the CSS code into Flow-Like.

### **Simple Agent Node** (formerly “Tool Calling”) — thanks @simonjanssen

PR with docs & examples: [https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/pull/180](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/pull/180)

Bring agentic behaviors into any workflow with a single node:

* Register tools (functions) the model may call
* Let the node plan → call tools → integrate results → continue
* Works with structured inputs/outputs so you can keep it **typed**
* Designed to chain with parsing, validation, and downstream nodes

This is a clean foundation for assistants that reason, act, and report back — right inside your graph.

---

### **HashSet Nodes** — thanks @GitBrincie212 🎉

New set-oriented building blocks for concise logic:

* Create, insert, remove
* `contains`, `len`, `is_empty`
* `union`, `intersection`, `difference` for branching logic

These nodes make list de-duplication, membership checks, and set math a snap.

---

### **Drag & Drop for Pin Editing** + Optimized Pin Editor

Editing pins is now **direct-manipulation**:

* Reorder pins via drag & drop
* Faster, cleaner editor with clearer affordances
* Reduced layout jank and improved focus handling

Together with execution & typing improvements from 0.0.2, editing complex nodes is far less fiddly.

---

### **Variable Folders**

Keep large projects tidy:

* Group variables into folders
* Collapse/expand to reduce visual noise
* Search still finds variables across folders

---

### Storage UX: **Create Folders Directly** — [#211](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/issues/211)

No more “upload a dummy folder” workaround. You can now create folders from the storage tab in one click.

---

### **New Landing Page**

We refreshed the website to better convey Flow-Like’s mission (typed, local-first workflows that scale) and to showcase the velocity of recent releases. More demos and deep dives are coming.

---

## Bug Fixes

* Fixed focus bug in node search field — [#220](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/issues/220)
* Changing a pin’s default **after** a connection no longer breaks the connection — [#153](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/issues/153)
* “Call by reference” on nodes with many inputs now renders correctly — [#128](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/issues/128)
* The **Add** button for pins works correctly in all cases — [#172](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/issues/172)
* **Layer Pins** correctly connect to **Generics** — [#208](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/issues/208)

---

## Smaller Changes

* Color indicator added to the **Variable Type** selector (quicker at-a-glance parsing)
* **Message Node** now supports **Tool Messages** (richer agent/LLM interactions)

---

## Thank you

Huge thanks to everyone filing issues, cutting PRs, and stress-testing the alpha — especially **@GitBrincie212** and **@simonjanssen** this cycle. Keep the feedback flowing. 💙

---

## Get it & try it

Grab installers and artifacts from the **Alpha v0.0.3 release page** and tell us what breaks — ideally with steps, logs, and screenshots. We’ll keep iterating fast. ([GitHub][1])

---

## What’s next

* Deeper type coverage across pins and edges
* Agent playground & evaluation tools
* More data views (diffs, schema checks)
* Governance & observability for enterprise workflows

Early testers shape the roadmap — your feedback directly impacts what ships next.
