Machine learning often feels like a black box — something only experts with GPUs and massive datasets can use. But that’s changing. Google’s **Teachable Machine** turned training custom models into a drag-and-drop experience. And now, with Flow-Like’s **Teachable Machine node**, those same models can run inside fully automated workflows.

That means you can move from an idea, to a trained AI model, to a running workflow in minutes — all without writing a single line of code.

In this guide, we’ll cover:

* What Teachable Machine is and why it matters
* How to train and export a TensorFlow Lite model
* How to connect and run your model in Flow-Like

## What is Teachable Machine?

Teachable Machine is a web-based tool from Google that makes machine learning approachable. Instead of writing TensorFlow or PyTorch code, you use a simple interface:

1. Define classes (the categories you want to recognize).
2. Upload or record sample data (images, audio, or poses).
3. Click **Train Model**.
4. Export the trained model for use anywhere.

It’s designed for speed and accessibility — ideal for rapid prototyping, education, or testing AI-driven ideas. What once took weeks of setup can now be done in minutes.

But training a model is only half the story. The real question is: **how do you use it?** That’s where Flow-Like comes in.

## Step 1: Define Your Use Case

In Teachable Machine, start by creating the classes you want your model to recognize. For this example, we defined two categories: **Thumbnails** and **Workflows**.

Each class needs a set of images. You can upload files or record directly from your webcam. Even with just a handful of examples, Teachable Machine can train a working model.

## Step 2: Train and Export the Model

Once your dataset is ready, train the model with a single click. Teachable Machine automatically handles preprocessing, architecture, and optimization.

Next, export your trained model:

* Select **TensorFlow Lite** as the format.
* Choose **Floating Point** for maximum compatibility.

This generates two files:

* A `.tflite` file containing the trained model.
* A `labels.txt` file listing your class names.

Both files are required for running the model in Flow-Like.

## Step 3: Connect the Model in Flow-Like

Flow-Like provides a dedicated **Teachable Machine node** that integrates seamlessly with your exported model. Setup is straightforward:

1. Load the `.tflite` model file.
2. Load the `labels.txt` file.
3. Provide an input image.
4. Connect the prediction output to any node — logging, visualization, or further automation.

Example workflow:

In this setup:

* A **Load Image** node feeds an image into the model.
* The **Teachable Machine node** runs inference.
* **Get Element** and **Class/Label** nodes interpret the result.
* The prediction is displayed using **Print Info**.

This allows Flow-Like to instantly recognize whether an image belongs to the Thumbnail or Workflow class — no custom inference code required.

## Why This Matters

Teachable Machine made it easy for anyone to train a model. Flow-Like makes it just as easy to **use** that model in production workflows.

* **Speed**: Train and deploy in minutes.
* **Accessibility**: No machine learning expertise required.
* **Integration**: Models can connect with any Flow-Like node.
* **Scalability**: Move from prototypes to enterprise workflows seamlessly.

AI becomes just another **building block** in your workflow — like timers, events, or data transformations.

## Get Started in 4 Steps

1. Visit [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).
2. Train a simple classifier with a few examples.
3. Export as **TensorFlow Lite (Floating Point)**.
4. Open Flow-Like and connect the **Teachable Machine node** with your model and labels.

In less than 10 minutes, you’ll have an AI-powered workflow running locally — without touching TensorFlow code.

## Conclusion

With Teachable Machine and Flow-Like, the journey from idea to automation has never been shorter. What used to be a technical barrier — training and deploying models — is now reduced to drag, drop, and connect.

AI is no longer just an experiment. It’s a practical, flexible, and accessible tool for anyone building workflows.

The next step is yours: train a model, drop it into Flow-Like, and watch your workflows get smarter.
