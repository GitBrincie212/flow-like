Three months after our first public alpha, we’re back with **Alpha v0.0.1** (published Aug 10, 2025). Thank you to everyone who tried the app, opened issues, and sent kind-but-brutally-honest feedback. And special shoutout to **@simonjanssen** for major node contributions—more below. ([GitHub][1])

> ⚠️ Alpha quality: still not production — please test, break things, and tell us how. ([GitHub][1])

## ✨ What’s new

* **New landing page** featuring models & real applications — a clearer path into Flow-Like.
* **Shared editing & multi-user projects** — collaborate without the “who has the latest file?” dance.
* **New Nodes**:
  * **GenAI Branching** and **Tool Calling**
  * **Classical ML nodes** (Image Classification, Object Detection, etc.) — **big thanks to Simon!**
* **New Layer Mode** — collapse node sections to tame complex canvases.
* **Performance boost** — noticeably faster app startup, fewer crashes.
* **Chat Interface out of the box** — configurable Chat Events with Tools, File Upload, and Example Prompts.
* **Lots of bug fixes** — stability and polish across the board.
