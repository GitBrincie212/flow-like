To boost your automations with AI we offer a rich catalog of language and vision models as well as embeddings in the *Explore Models* section.

You can download as many models as you like (and as disk space is available). Once downloaded, you can add a model to your *[Profile](/start/profiles/)* by clicking on the three-dots button of a model card. You can access all models linked to your *[Profile](/start/profiles/)* in the *[Studio](/studio/overview/)* environment.
