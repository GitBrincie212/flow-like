Flow-Like is a **Workflow Builder and Operating System**:
- It supports *workflows*, allowing you to automate *any* process.
- It is a full-stack *builder suite*, enabling you to implement automations as *flows* and create interfaces to interact with them *without writing code*.
- It is an *operating system*, providing OS-grade, standalone functionalities such as storage, databases, and user management. You can even run it completely offline if desired.

Flow-Like includes *but is not limited to* AI capabilities for automations:
- You can embed advanced reasoning models like Large Language Models (LLMs) as routers, agents, or transformers within your flows.

We've designed Flow-Like not only for AI but, first and foremost, for uncompromising performance, efficiency, and security. It comes with built-in infrastructure â€” because, in our experience, this is the truly missing cornerstone to scale your AI transformation *for any flow you like*.
