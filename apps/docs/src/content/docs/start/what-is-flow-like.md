FlowLike is a **Workflow Builder and Operating System**:
- It supports *workflows* in the sense that you can automate *any* process with it.
- It is a full-stack *builder suite* in the sense that you can implement automations as *flows* and create interfaces to interact with them *without writing code*.
- It is an *operating system* in the sense that it provides to you OS-grade, standalone functionalities such as storage, databases, access and user management. You can run it completely offline (if you like).

FlowLike includes *but is not limited to* AI-capabilities for automations:
- You can embed advanced reasoning models like Large Language Models (LLMs) as routers, agents or transformers within your flows (if you like).

We've designed FlowLike not only for AI but first and foremost for uncomprimising performance, efficiency, and security. It comes with built-in infrastructure - because that is what we've experienced is the truely missing cornerstone to scale your AI transformation *for any flow you like*.
