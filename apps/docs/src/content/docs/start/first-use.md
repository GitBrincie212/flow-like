When first opening the desktop app of FlowLike you are prompted to select a [Profile](/start/profiles). A *Profile* bundles configurations and language models for you. To start, the **Chat Profile** is a good option.

In the next step, FlowLike downloads some first [models](/start/models/) for you. You can either wait until done or head over to the next step and letting the download continue in the background.

Next, you can see the landing page of the desktop app. Awesome! You made it! 

*Welcome to FlowLike!* ðŸŽ‰
