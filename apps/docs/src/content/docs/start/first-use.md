When you first open the Flow-Like Desktop app, you are prompted to select a [Profile](/start/profiles). A *Profile* bundles configurations and language models for you. To get started, **Chatting** is a good option:

In the next step, Flow-Like downloads some initial [language models](/start/models/) for you. You can either wait until the download is complete or proceed to the next step and let the download continue in the background:

Next, you will see the landing page of the desktop app. Congratulationsâ€”you made it!

*Welcome to Flow-Like!* ðŸŽ‰

There are additional features of the desktop app to explore next, or you can jump ahead and [create your first app](/docs/apps/create/) to start building a workflow.
