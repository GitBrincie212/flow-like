To boost your automations with AI we offer a rich catalog of language and vision models as well as embeddings in the **Explore Models** section of the desktop app.

You can download as many models as you like (and as disk space is available). Once downloaded, you can add a model to your [Profile](/start/profiles/) by clicking on the three-dots button of a model card. You can access all models linked to your [Profile](/start/profiles/) in the [Studio](/studio/overview/) environment.
