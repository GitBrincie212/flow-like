To boost your automations with AI we offer a rich catalog of language and vision models as well as embeddings in the **Explore Models** section of the desktop app:

![FlowLike Catalog for Large Language Models and Embedding Models](../../../assets/ModelCatalog.webp)

You can download as many models as you like (and as disk space is available). Once downloaded, you can add a model to your [Profile](/start/profiles/) by clicking on the three-dots button of a model card:

Once linked to your [Profile](/start/profiles/), you can access a model in the [Studio](/studio/overview/) environment when building and executing *Flows*.
