By default, you are using your Flow-Like instance offline. We've pulled some language models from the internet for you, but apart from that, no data is sent to our servers.

Flow-Like is designed for offline use, so it's no problem if you are temporarily without internet: you can still run your flows and interact with your local LLMs.

If you like, you *can* log in and create an account using your email, Google, or Apple account. Being logged in allows you to access your data across devices and share it with others. We'll sync [online apps](/apps/offline-online/) for you the next time you are online.
