Flow boards include built-in versioning (accessible via *Board Settings* in the top navigation bar of Flow-Like Studio):

Flow execution is tied to board versions (the default is *latest*). You can configure [events](/apps/events/) to link to either the *latest* version or a *specific* version of your board. This allows you to safely manage transitions between releases (e.g., for users of your app).
