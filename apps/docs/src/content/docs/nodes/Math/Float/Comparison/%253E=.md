title: Greater Than Or Equal (Float)
description: Compares two floating-point numbers to determine if the first one is greater than or equal to the second one.

## Purpose of the Node
The Greater Than Or Equal (Float) node evaluates whether the value of the first input pin is greater than or equal to the value of the second input pin. It outputs a boolean result: `true` if the first float is greater than or equal to the second float, and `false` otherwise.

## Pins
| Pin Name        | Pin Description                                         | Pin Type | Value Type |
|:----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|:---------|:-----------|
| **First Float** | The first floating-point number to compare.            | Float    | Number     |
| **Second Float**| The second floating-point number to compare.           | Float    | Number     |
| **Is Greater or Equal** | The result of the comparison, `true` if the first float is greater than or equal to the second float, otherwise `false`. | Boolean  | Normal     |
