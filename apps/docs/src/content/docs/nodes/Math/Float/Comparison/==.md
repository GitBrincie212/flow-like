## Purpose of the Node
The Equal Float node is used to compare two floating-point numbers (floats) and determine if they are equal within a specified tolerance. This is particularly useful when dealing with floating-point precision issues where exact equality might not be feasible.

## Pins
| Pin Name | Pin Description | Pin Type | Value Type |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|:------:|
| Float 1 | The first float to be compared. | Float | Number |
| Float 2 | The second float to be compared. | Float | Number |
| Tolerance | The tolerance value within which the floats are considered equal. | Float | Number |
| Is Equal | The output boolean indicating whether the two floats are equal within the specified tolerance. | Boolean | Normal |
