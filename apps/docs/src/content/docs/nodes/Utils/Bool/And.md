## Purpose of the Node
The **Bool And** node evaluates a series of boolean inputs and outputs the result of performing a logical AND operation on them. Each input pin is a boolean, and the output pin will be `true` only if all input pins are `true`; otherwise, it will be `false`.

## Pins
| Pin Name | Pin Description | Pin Type | Value Type |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:------:|:------:|
| boolean | Input Pin for AND Operation | Struct | Boolean |
| boolean | Input Pin for AND Operation | Struct | Boolean |
| result | AND operation between all boolean inputs | String | Boolean |
