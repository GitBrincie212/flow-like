In the **Templates** section of your app settings you can create *Flow Templates* based on existing *Flows* part of your app's *Boards*.

Once created, *FlowLike Templates* can be reused by you and others in new apps.

With *templates* you're blueprinting a certain *execution or processing logic* whereas with *public apps* you're sharing a full app including all its *boards*, *flows*, *events*, *storage* and *databases*.
