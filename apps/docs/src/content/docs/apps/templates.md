In the **Templates** section of your app settings, you can create *Flow Templates* based on existing *Flows* within your app's *Boards*.  

Once created, *Flow-like Templates* can be reused by you and others when building new apps.  

With *templates*, you are defining a blueprint for a specific *execution or processing logic*, whereas with *public apps*, you are sharing a complete app, including all its *boards*, *flows*, *events*, *storage*, and *databases*.
