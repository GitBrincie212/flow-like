When creating apps in FlowLike, you can choose to make them either **offline** or **online**.

Unlike offline apps, **online apps** can be shared with other users, published in the **FlowLike App Store**, and accessed from multiple devices. Regardless of the mode, you can always export any app and re-import it later if you prefer not to go online.

### Why Choose Offline or Online at App Creation?
Currently, it is not yet possible to convert an offline app into an online app after creation. However, this feature is planned. You can track our progress in [this issue](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/issues/280).

### Does My Online App Run in the Cloud?
No. In FlowLike Desktop, being *online* simply means that your appâ€™s metadata, storage, and flow *definitions* are stored in the cloud. The actual *execution* still takes place on your local machine.

Please make sure you are using the same version of FlowLike on all devices from which you want to access your online apps.
