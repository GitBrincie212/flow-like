When creating apps in FlowLike you can decide whether you want to create them as **offline** or **online** apps.

Different to offline apps, you can **share** online apps with other users, publish them in the **FlowLike App Store** or access them from different devices. Nonetheless, you can always export all apps and import them again if you do not want to go online.

### Why Set Offline vs. Online at App Creation Time?
Because we haven't implemented the feature to transition from offline to online yet. But we definitely will. Checkout the progress of this feature in our [in this issue](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/issues/280).

### Does my Online App Run in the Cloud?
No, being *online* with FlowLike Desktop simply means that we store your app's metadata, storage and flow *definitions* in the cloud. *Execution* is still carried out on your local machine.

Please ensure that you are using the same version of FlowLike on all devices you want to access your online apps from.
