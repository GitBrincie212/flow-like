Sharing and visibility features require that you have [logged in with your FlowLike account](/start/login/) and that your app is set to **online** (see [Offline vs. Online](/apps/offline-online/)).

## App Visibility

By default, your online app is set to **private** and therefore only accessible to you on all devices where you are logged in. You can change this in the **General** settings tab of your app (**Visibility Status** section):

The minimum visibility level to share your app with others is **Prototype**. This allows you to share your app with other FlowLike users.

Once you progress with your app you can elevate the visibility of your app to **Public Request** or **Public** so it becomes available in in the **FlowLike App Store**.

## Sharing Your App

Once your app is set to at least **Prototype** visibility level, you'll find the **Team** tab in your app's settings.

Within the **Team** tab, switch to the **Invite & Access** bar where you can invite FlowLike users or create an invite link for your app:

## Rights and Roles

As app **owner** you can assign different **roles** to your app team members. Roles can be defined in the **Roles** tab of your app's settings. You can assign specific **permissions** to each role for fine-grained access control:
