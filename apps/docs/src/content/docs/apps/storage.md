Every FlowLike app comes with dedicated **Storage** and **Databases**:

- **Storage** allows you to upload and manage files and directories for use in your flows. You can either select files from your local machine or drag and drop them directly.  
- **Explore Data** lets you inspect all databases created and populated by your flows.

## Upload Directory
Here you can upload files and entire folders to make them part of your app. For online apps, the files are stored in the cloud and synchronized across all devices where you are logged in with your FlowLike account:

## Databases
You can create relational databases in your flows (for example, to store processed data in a structured way). All databases created in your flows are shown here:
