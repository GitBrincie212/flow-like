In the **Flows** section of your app, you can create and manage your *workflows* as **Boards**.

Within an app, you can create any number of **Boards**, and each **Board** can contain multiple **Flows**.

By default, new apps include an **Initial Board**. Once you open it, you can start building your first **Flow** in our [Studio](/studio/overview/) builder environment. This is where the magic happens!
