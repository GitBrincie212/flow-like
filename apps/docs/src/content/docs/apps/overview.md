With FlowLike **Apps** you manage and organize your automations in projects. 

Whereas **FlowLike** is the overall platform, the "operating system" (which you get by opening the FlowLike desktop app for example), **FlowLike Apps** are *specific* projects that you create and work in.

Every **FlowLike App** allows you to:
- Create [Boards for Flows](/apps/boards/) using our [Studio](/studio/overview/) builder environment,
- Create custom [user interfaces](/apps/chat-ui/) and link them to your **Flows**,
- Link **Flows** to the outside world using [Events](/apps/events/),
- [Upload files and folders](/apps/storage/),
- Manage and inspect [databases](/apps/storage/),
- [Share and collaborate](/apps/share/) with team members,
- Create [releases](/apps/versioning/) of your app,
- Reuse your ideas and automations using [Templates](/apps/templates/).
