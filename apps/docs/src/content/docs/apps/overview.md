With **FlowLike Apps**, you can manage and organize your automations within dedicated projects.

While **FlowLike** refers to the overall platform—the "operating system" you access, for example, by opening the FlowLike desktop app—**FlowLike Apps** are the specific projects you create and work in.

Each **FlowLike App** enables you to:
- Create [Boards for Flows](/apps/boards/) using our [Studio](/studio/overview/) builder environment,  
- Build custom [user interfaces](/apps/chat-ui/) and connect them to your **Flows**,  
- Link **Flows** to the outside world through [Events](/apps/events/),  
- [Upload files and folders](/apps/storage/),  
- Manage and inspect [databases](/apps/storage/),  
- [Share and collaborate](/apps/share/) with your team,  
- Create [releases](/apps/versioning/) of your app,  
- Reuse your ideas and automations with [Templates](/apps/templates/).
