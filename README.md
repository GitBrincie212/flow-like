# Flow-Like: Your Next Generation Workflow OS.

> *Any flow you like.*

üîÄ Flow-Like is an enterprise-grade **workflow operating system**.

‚ú® It comes with a modular frontend for apps, a rich set of events, a **node catalog**, a powerful **no-code** workflow IDE, and an extensive suite to manage teams, templates and projects within your organization.

ü§ñ Flow-Like lives in a seamless, unopinionated integration of **LLM**, ML-based, and deterministic decision making instances to **automate** any process.

‚ö°Ô∏è We build Flow-Like upon Rust ü¶Ä for uncompromising **performance**, efficiency and code safety.

ü§ù It is **Open Source**.

## Quick Start üöÄ
Try and use Flow-Like:
- [Download ‚¨áÔ∏è](https://github.com/TM9657/flow-like/releases) and run the latest stable build of our standalone desktop app, *or*
- Skip the the setup and [try our hosted version in the cloud ‚òÅÔ∏è](https://flow-like.com/) (to be available soon), *or*
- [Build the desktop app from source ‚öôÔ∏è](#build-from-source) (see instructions below).

## Flow-Like‚Äôs Ecosystem üåê
### Apps
Manage your workflows and storages with apps that you can share with others. Create apps offline, online, run them locally or in the cloud:

### Studio
Our innovative, no-code workflow builder IDE. Connect, collapse, and annotate. Get automated predictions for matching nodes. Trace execution logs and triggering events:

### Node Catalog
- Build your workflows from a rich set of execution nodes - from branching, databases to object detection and higher-order agent nodes. 
- Link your application to frontends, backends, and third party apps, for example to chat interfaces or incoming mails.
- Checkout the full catalog in our [docs üìÑ](https://docs.flow-like.com/).

### Templates
Reuse and share your workflows as templates:
<p align="center"><img width="800" src="https://cdn.flow-like.com/website/Store.webp" alt="Browse Public Apps in the Store"></p>

### AI Models
Download and run LLMs, VLMs, Deep Learning Models, and Embeddings locally or in the cloud. Boost your workflows with intelligent nodes:

## Why Use Flow-Like? üí°
Flow-Like helps *developers and individuals* to efficiently craft highly individualized workflow automations:
- Choose from a wide node and event catalog for different computational tasks and triggers
- Efficiently synthesize automations via standardized interfaces, data objects using a powerful builder interface
- Share and copy workflows as templates and projects to streamline collaboration.
- Contribute project or enterprise specific nodes and events to the core catalog 

Flow-Like helps *business responsibles* to express application logic in a natural way:
- Build workflows without coding. Flows act both as documentation and execution.
- Collapse lower-level flows into meaningful hierarchical abstractions.
- Fine-grained access controls for teams and projects.

Flow-Like helps *IT* to manage and operate application stacks:
- Bring your applications to a unified set of nodes that eases operations, incidence management, governance, and compliance.
- Transition seamlessly from Proof-of-Concepts to productive, production-ready applications
- Run your applications efficiently thanks to Rust‚Äôs performance guarantees
- Built-in version control

## Build From Source ‚öôÔ∏è
For the latest features, you can build the standalone desktop app yourself:
1. Install Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install
2. Install Bun: https://bun.com/docs/installation
3. Install Tauri prerequisites: https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/
4. Install Protobuf: https://protobuf.dev/installation/
5. Clone this repository
6. Run `bun install && bun run build:desktop`

Checkout our docs for specific hints for MacOS, Windows and Linux.
