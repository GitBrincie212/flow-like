# Project general coding standards

## Comments and Verbosity
- Do not comment code that is self-explanatory.
- Avoid verbose comments; use concise, clear language.

## Focus on DRY
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Use components, functions, and utilities to avoid code duplication.
- Do not create huge logic blocks; break them into smaller, reusable functions.
